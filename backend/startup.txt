# Azure App Service Startup Command
# Copy this command to Azure Portal → App Service → Configuration → General settings → Startup Command

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Alternative startup commands:
# Option 1: Using startup script
# python -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python run_server.py

# Option 2: Using module uvicorn
# python -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Note: Always include dependency installation (python -m pip install -r requirements.txt)
# because Azure creates fresh containers that don't have dependencies installed.

# IMPORTANT: No environment variables need to be configured in Azure App Service settings.
# All secrets and configuration are loaded from the environment_production.cfg file
# which is deployed with the application code.

# NOTE: The GitHub Actions workflow now deploys:
# - backend/ directory (FastAPI app)
# - geo_ner/ directory (NER services)
# - requirements.txt (dependencies)
# So the startup command should NOT include "cd backend" - we're already in the right directory.
